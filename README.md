# DevOps Labs

This repo contains my step-by-step practice labs for Cloud & DevOps fundamentals.

## ðŸ“… Structure
- `week1-linux/` â†’ Linux basics (users, SSH, systemd, logs)
- `week2-networking/` â†’ Networking fundamentals
- `week3-git/` â†’ Git version control practice
- `week4-docker/` â†’ Docker containerization
- `week5-kubernetes/` â†’ Kubernetes basics
- `cheatsheets/` â†’ Quick review checklists (Linux, Networking, Git, Docker, etc.)

## ðŸš€ How I Use This
1. Each lab has:
   - `instructions.md` â†’ Problem statement
   - `runbook.md` â†’ My solution
   - Scripts/config files
2. Weekly review with checklists.
3. Build up scenarios for interview prep.
